        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Need something to do with your bananas once they go all brown. Banana bread is a great option, my partner and I freeze all the bananas we don't get to eating and once we have about 4 or more then use those to make banana bread. 

            Slightly sweet and packed full of banana flavor this bread tastes great toasted with a generous spread of butter. This is great for breakfast or for an afternoon snack.
