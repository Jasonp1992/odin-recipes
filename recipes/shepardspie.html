        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil</li>
            <li>While you wait of the water to boil, cut potatoes into one inch cubes and wash till the wash water runs clear</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling add the potatoes to the water and cook until a fork can easily peirce the potatoes</li>
            <li>Drain water form the potatoes and return them to the pot they were cooking in</li>
            <li>Add the butter and milk to the potatoes along with a pinch of salt and pepper and mash till the potatoes are smooth</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed, Put the potatoes aside for now till we have the sauce finished</li>
            <li>In a 10 inch cast iron pan or other oven safe pan, heat one tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>Once pan is hot add the ground beef, once the beef starts to brown use a spatula to brake up the beef into small chunks</li>
            <li>Turn on you ovens broiler to medium and let it warm up</li>
            <li>Once the beef is just about done cooking drain off any liquid that might have accumulated in the pan</li>
            <li>return the pan to the heat and add the onions and mushrooms, saute until the onions are soft and translucent and the mushrooms have softened</li>
            <li>Add the can of cream of mushroom soup and half of the can of water, stir until the soup is smooth and mixed well with the meat and vegetables</li>
            <li>Add the packet of au jus sauce, frozen corn, and frozen peas to the pan, stir till well mixed</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat till hot</li>
            <li>Removed the pot from the heat, smooth out the sauce so its evenly distributed in the pan</li>
            <li>Scoop the potatoes and spread them on top of the sauce, this is a little tricky a good idea is to take small scoops and dollop it on top of the sauce</li>
            <li>At this point if you would like to add cheese, sprinkle the cheese on top of the mashed potatoes</li>
            <li>Now take your pan with everything in it and put it under the broiler until the cheese is melted and the potatoes have started to brown. If you did not add the cheese I still put it under the broiler till the mash potatoes have started to brown. But if you don't want to do this step it can be skipped </li>
            <li>Scoop out into a bowl or a plate and its ready to serve optionally garnish with fresh chopped parsley</li>
        </ol>
