            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                I developed this sausage and Broccoli pasta recipe after going to a this great little Italian restaurant in Kingston, MA. The concept is simple spicy sausage saut√©ed up with broccoli in a rich sauce served over pasta. If carbs are your thing then don't shy away from pairing this with a this slice of bread to sop up that sauce. while your at it a crisp white wine cuts the richness of this dish perfectly. 

                So for your next date night really wow that special person with this delicious but vary simple pasta recipe. It will get you that second date I guarantee it.
